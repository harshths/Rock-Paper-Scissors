# Rock-Paper-Scissors
So... this is my second project, same on java script.. so this is a hand game which we played a lot at our school time, I just try to make a webpage where you can choose your options.. like - rock, paper or scissor, anything you like, there is a computer bot who choose his option.. and if you win or lose.. it will show you the output.
